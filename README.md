# HashtableWithIterator

* This data structure doesn't preserve the insertion order, neither it sorts the inserted data based on keys or values.
* Hashtable never save key or value in order. For that, you ust use another data structure like <b>LinkedHashMap</b> and <b>Treemap</b>

# Enumeration vs Iterator
Enumeration and Iterator are two interfaces in java.util package which are used to traverse over the elements of a Collection object. Though they perform the same function i.e traversing the Collection object, there are some differences exist between them. Using Enumeration, you can only traverse the Collection object. But using Iterator, you can also remove an element while traversing the Collection. This is the one major difference between Enumeration and Iterator in java. You can say Iterator is some what advanced version of Enumeration.
